==============================

## Installation

Download the `Github-2017.icls` file and copy it to:

```
~/Library/Preferences/PhpStormXXXX.X/colors
```

Restart your PhpStorm and you'll see the theme there.

## Suggestion

If you want a perfect theme use the `SF-Mono` font. I's used by Github and you can find it in Mac OSX Sierra.
